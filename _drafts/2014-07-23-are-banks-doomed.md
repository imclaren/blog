*Services provided by telecommunications companies were commoditised in the early 2000s. Are banks next?*

###1. The rise and fall of the telcos

[Ben Evans](http://ben-evans.com) recently made the point (in [Unbundling innovation: Samsung, PCs and China](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/7/10/unbundling-innovation)) that most truly innovative internet services are invented by companies that are built (from the ground up) to sell technology to third parties.  In other words, by companies that sell technology services as their core business.    

But what if our CEO's [elevator pitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2bLNkCqpuY) does not include the words *"sell technology services"*, but instead includes the words *"sell telecommunications services"* or *"provide banking services"*?  Isn't that the same thing?  Before the iPhone was released (i.e. back in the early 2000s), telecommunications companies certainly thought so.  

As Ben says, the telcos were:

>"intensely aware of all the cool stuff that was going to happen with mobile and the internet.  They predicted a great deal of it very accurately, but they thought that they would be doing all of it. 

[They thought wrong](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qycUOENFIBs).  

Traditionally, telcos controlled the services that run on their physical infrastructure (i.e. over their land lines and fiber networks, and via their wireless spectrum).  The telcos were able to book significant margins for these services (e.g. phone minutes and SMS).  Telcos also tightly controlled the types of phones (and other similar devices) that customers could buy.  

But, as Ben points out, the telcos were unable to compete (i.e. maintain control over these devices and services) because:

- they were structurally bad at making services;
- even if they were good, those services were just one amongst many; and
- the network effects for these services ran across the whole internet, not just their customers.

In other words, the [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone/) and then [Android](http://www.android.com) ate their collective lunch.  Specialist technology providers sold (i.e. unbundled) physical phones and services from the infrastructure owned by the telcos.  And the days of the telcos making significant margins on services (e.g. phone minutes and SMSs) are now long gone. 

### 2. Will banking services also be commoditised?

This brings us to banks.

[McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com) also published an article recently about [the rise of the digital bank](http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/Business_Technology/The_rise_of_the_digital_bank?cid=DigitalEdge-eml-alt-mip-mck-oth-1407).  The argument in this article is  that as *"European consumers move online, retail banks will have to follow. The problem is that most banks arenâ€™t ready"*.  

I am sure that this is true, but I think that the article  misses the wider point.  Are banks failing to provide "digital" services because they are not ready, or because they cannot (i.e. are not built to) compete with dedicated technology service providers? 

Let's take a step back.  What services do banks actually provide?  For most individual customers, banks (in Western countries at least):
- store their money in savings accounts;
- allow customers to pay for goods and services using debit and credit cards;
- allow customers to withdraw cash from ATMs;
- provide internet banking services (via the web and mobile apps) to allow customers to check their account balances and transfer money; and
- loan money to these customers (for houses and other tangible goods).

Banks also provide lots of other services.  Including liquidity to Australian businesses and individuals.  And I am sure that I have missed a few key ones.  But I think that the above gives us a general idea of the core reasons why most individual customers use banks.  For example, customers can also:
- go into a branch (although, unless there is some sort of problem, how often do they do this?);
- pay for goods and services using cheques (a payment method that cannot be much longer for this world);
- provide "wealth" services, superannuation and insurance advice;
- etc.

Therefore I think that telcos are arguably in a better position than the banks.  Telcos have infrastructure (i.e. the landlines, fibre networks, and wireless spectrum) that may become, or arguably already are,  commodities.  But people still need this infrastructure to actually use these new internet services (i.e. to make phone calls and access the internet). 

On the other hand, unlike telcos, if all of the bank "infrastructure" (other than possibly ATMs) went away, in the long term how much would that effect the average banking customer?  When we come right down to it, do these current bank customers actually need to deal with banks?  Especially if bank competitors (e.g [bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) or [PayPal](http://paypal.com)) provide ways to store money, pay for goods and services (and remove the requirement for cards, ATMs, and physical cash), and loan money to customers at scale (e.g., and don't laugh, by [croudsourcing](https://angel.co)).

### 3. Are banks doomed?

No.  I think.  But it will be a challenge.  Here is Ben again: 

> The analogy I often use in this case is that [this] ... is like a municipal water company deciding to get into the soda business - because it knows water, and has trucks, and customers trust its brand. Even if it managed to come up with a great soda, it would still be just another can of soda amongst many.

> It isn't their place to provide it ... even if they could.

I am bullish.  But to win, banks need to stay ahead of their non-bank competitors.  And provide world-beating, or at least world leading, technology (and particularly payment) services.  

That is the challenge.
