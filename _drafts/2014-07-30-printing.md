*Forget saving the environment.  Printing at work is a ridiculous waste of time.*

#### 1. Printing at work is ludicrous  

About a month ago, I was forced to print for the first time since I started at my current job.  Until then, I had not printed a single document at work (i.e. for about a year and a half).  I don't print because this significantly increases my personal productivity.

Funny story.  Our internal electronic expenses system requires physical signatures. So I had to ask our support people to authorise printer access so I could print that one document.  I haven't printed at work since.   

#### 2.  And handwritten work notes are ridiculous

I sat in a meeting last week that involved a lot of very serious people scribbling furiously on legal pads.  What an immense waste of time.  

Because here's the thing.  It's not real if it's not stored in electronic form.  If its important, we will type it into a word document as a file note or memo, and store it on a backed up computer system.  Therefore, I propose that we skip writing things down and instead just type our meeting notes into word documents.  There is no law against typing the note into an email that you send to yourself.

Then, if we need to write a formal note or memo.  Or otherwise actually use that information.  Then it's already typed into a computer.  We don't have to hunt down a piece of paper, that may no longer exist, to re-type what we have already written.

And Ok Ok, I acknowledge that taking this next step - and completely removing paper from work - might just be me.

#### 3.  Wireless technology required

Why is this possible now?  Always-on wireless technology.  The ability to pick up our laptops and take them to any meeting anywhere.  

Your organisation lets you do that.  Doesn't it?

And I find that I also need a smart phone for tasks, and a tablet as a replacement whiteboard.  But that's it.

#### 4.  But I need to print large documents!  Fallacy.

When I tell people that I don't print.  And after they stop looking at me as if I had just said that I wear flower pots on my head.  Their first complaint is usually that it is impossible to review and negotiate suites of documents without printing them out.

I am a lawyer.  And have printed documents, on an enormous scale, for over a decade.  For example, when I moved law firms, I archived walls and walls full of floor to ceiling bookcases of printed files.  

Don't get me wrong.  I am not proud of the whole killing rainforest thing.  But my point is that chosing not to print is a productivity issue.  Not and environmental issue.  

Put simply, I am more effective if I don't print, and there is no need to print to be effective.  Even when dealing with huge numbers of huge documents.

#### 5.  And I need to hand write notes, and to print to double check my work! Also a fallacy. 

Lawyers trained at large firms always double (at least) check their documents.  If we hand write our changes to the document, and then review the electronic copy later, then we are much more likely to spot our own errors.  Our typos, mistakes, and logical gaps.  For example, I was trained as follows:
- Print out the Microsoft Word document and hand write our proposed changes;
- Ask my secretary to make those changes in the Microsoft Word document (while always [tracking changes](http://iainmclaren.com/2014/07/16/8-steps)).
- Repeat the above steps as necessary; and
- Then email the contract to the client (or the other parties involved in the transaction), and print out that contract and the mail to go on the file.

However, we get the same result if we complete our changes to the document, leave the document, and move on to something else (or preferably wait until the next day).  And then re-review the document before we sent it out.    

#### 6.  Don't print.  You will never go back.

I stopped printing documents and, after a month or two, stopped missing the paper copies.  Even for massive documents with multiple attachments. Don't get me wrong.  I have a soft spot for the antiquated.  Really.  But I think that it is time to recognise that printing at work, and writing work notes on paper, is a ridiculous waste of time. 

My suggestion is to try not printing at work for three months.  And if you are bold, try going without pen and paper at work as well.  

Oh, and yes, it would also be great if we cut down fewer trees.
