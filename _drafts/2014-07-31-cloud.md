title: What if Amazon and Google switch off the cloud?
---

*They run your (or your key suppliers) technology systems used by you .  What if they switch off the cloud?*

![Cloud](http://iainmclaren.com/public/images/cloud.jpg "Cloud")

####  (1) The cloud used to be called floppy disks

Why do I obsess about backups?  I am glad you asked.

Back in the stone ages (i.e. when I attended University), I worked in information technology services at the University.  Our brief was to solve any and all technology problems of our University staff members and students.  

It was an enormous brief.  We fixed printers.  We helped out with tricky programming assignments.  We diagnosed weird email problems over the phone.  We fixed Microsoft Word formatting, and helped with Excel formulas.  We pulled computers apart and put them together again.  We explained how email worked.  And what this new "internet" thing is.  Yes I am old.

But the floppy disks.  That is what stuck with me.  In those days, if you wanted to read email, you installed an email program on a floppy disk. And all your emails were also stored on this floppy disk.  I bet that you can see where this story is going ...

Three times during my stint working at the University, PhD candidates brought in floppy disks containing the only copy of their PhD thesis.  And the floppy disks were broken. Each time I managed to retrieve the entire file, or at least the text of the thesis.  But for many students and staff who came to us with broken floppy disks, their assignments were irretrievably lost. 

####  (2) Now half the cloud is run by email hosting companies

I exaggerate a little, but Google has quietly and gently integrated itself into our lives.

Which company is storing your personal email?  I assume that you are not hosting your own mail server.  I used to run mail servers for 100+ users and let me tell you, it is very very stressful worrying about 24x7x365 uptime.  So we quite sensibly let companies that do this for a living run our mail severs.  And that probably means Google.

Google also have a service called google apps that allows you to use your own domain name (e.g. iain@mydomain.com) for a monthly fee.  Therefore, if you don't know which company is running your mail server.  Or your company's mail server.  It is probably Google.  

####  (3) And the other half of the cloud is run by Amazon or their competitors

One way or another, everyone relies on Amazon.

Yes the online book store.  Amazon also rents out servers and storage space.  You can give Amazon your credit card and immediately upload and store infinite (for all intents and purposes) content on Amazon's servers for a low monthly fee.  As [Benedict Evans](http://stratechery.com) says (in [Losing my Amazon Religion](http://stratechery.com/2014/losing-amazon-religion/)):

> And to be sure, Amazon has had doubters from the beginning: few gave the company a chance when it started, and even fewer thought it would survive the bursting of the bubble. And yet, today Amazon is the king of e-commerce, at least in the United States, and the clear leader in cloud services, and now they are making a big push into digital content and devices.

Amazon has an enormous global fleet of data centres.  Amazon supplies the infrastructure that is critical for either:

- a significant proportion of large organisations (in the Western world at least); or 
- the suppliers of these large companies.  

Everyone relies on Amazon.  Amazon runs the servers for everything from online storage services (such as [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)), to the web pages of governments, financial institutions, and airlines.

####  (4) So what are our options?  

Our options are actually quite simple (spoiler: option 4 is the only sensible option):

1. **No backups (or no use of the cloud):**  This is the floppy disc option.  Which is not an option for the reasons discussed above.  
2. **Run cloud severs ourselves:** Far too complicated and risky unless you run servers for a living.  This is also not an option
3. **Use cloud services without keeping our own copies of documents:**  What happens if Amazon or Google decide to stop providing the service that you use?  Amazon and Google discontinue services all the time.  Therefore, this is also not a realistic option.
4. **Use cloud services but keep our own backups:**  The only sensible option.

####  (5) The simple solution - cloud and personal backups

Use the cloud, but retain copies of critical documents on servers (or storage devices) that we control.  And in particular:

- companies should have backups, including for all of those companies' critical cloud arrangements.  Does yours?  Please check.
- And if your phone is stolen or your house burns down, I assume that you have backups of you irreplaceable personal photos and documents?  Please please tell me that you use [Backblaze](http://backblaze.com) or [Crashplan](http://crashplan.com).  Or perhaps [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)?  Or some other similar product.

In other words, what's the plan if Amazon and Google switch off the cloud?  Backups.
