*Forget saving the environment.  Printing at work is a ridiculous waste of time.*

#### 1. Printing at work is ludicrous

A few months ago, I needed to print and sign forms for our internal electronic expenses system.  And yes, I love irony.  But I haven't printed at work since.

I don't print because this significantly increases my personal productivity.  Don't get me wrong.  I love paper and books.  Lemony Snicket[1] said it best:

> Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.

#### 2.  And handwritten work notes are ridiculous

But as I sat in a meeting last week that involved a lot of very serious people scribbling furiously on legal pads.  I thought — what an incredible waste of time. 

Because here's the thing.  It's not real if it's not stored in electronic form.  If its important, we type it in.  We store it on a computer system.  We avoid wasting time typing up our hand-written notes.  

So I propose that we not write things down.  Let's just type our meeting notes into word documents.  Or whatever application suits our workflow — there is no law against just typing meeting notes in an email that we send to ourselves.[2]  Whatever works. 

#### 3.  Wireless technology required

Why is going paperless possible now?  Always-on wireless technology.  The ability to pick up our laptops, and take them with us to any meeting anywhere.  Your organisation does let you do that, and provides you with global wireless internet access. And [backups](http://iainmclaren.com/2014/08/05/cloud2/).  Doesn't it?

And yes, I find that I also need a smart phone for tasks, and a tablet as a replacement whiteboard (or to add a copy of my signature to a pdf document in a pinch).  But that's it.

#### 4.  But I need to print large documents!  Fallacy.

I am a lawyer, so I printed work documents on an enormous scale for over a decade.  For example, when I moved law firms, I archived walls and walls full of floor to ceiling bookcases of printed files.  

Don't get me wrong.  I am not proud of destroying rainforests.  But my point is that chosing not to print is a productivity issue.  Not an environmental issue.  

Put simply, I am more effective if I don't print, and there is no need to print to be effective.  Even when dealing with huge numbers of huge documents.

#### 5.  And I need to hand write notes, and print to double check my work! Also a fallacy.

Lawyers trained at large firms always double (or triple, or quadruple) check their work.  For example, I was trained to:
- print out a Microsoft Word document; 
- hand write changes to the document;
- ask my secretary to type those changes into the Microsoft Word document ([while always tracking changes](http://iainmclaren.com/2014/07/16/8-steps));
- email the document to the client (and the other parties involved in the transaction); and
- finally, print out the document and email to go on the file.

But we get the same result (i.e. spot typos, errors, and outright mistakes and gaps in logic) if we make our changes to the electronic document.  We can then move on to something else (preferably overnight) and then re-check the document one more time before we send it out.   

#### 6.  Don't print.  You will never go back.

I stopped printing documents and, after a month or two, did not miss having paper copies of those documents.  Even for enormous documents with multiple attachments. 

I do have a soft spot for books and the antiquated.  Really.  For example, [Moleskin](http://www.moleskine.com) notebooks are [beautiful](http://iainmclaren.com/2014/07/30/perfection/).  And I have friends who write notes and diagrams in these notebooks, and then use their phone cameras to digitise those written notes.  But I think that it's time to recognise that printing at work (and I would also argue writing work notes on paper) is a ridiculous waste of time. 

So [I challenge you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iOi_iPNC50) to not print for three months.  And if you are bold, try to also refrain from using pens and paper during this three month period.

Oh, and yes, it would also be great if we cut down fewer trees.

[1] And yes Josh, I did just quote Lemony Snicket (from   *Horseradish*).  That's $5 you owe me.   

[2] Well, actually, there are some laws that apply in relation to regulated industries (for example) that restrict the transmission of highly sensitive information over the internet (including via email).  But these laws only require us to change our workflow (i.e. potentially change which apps we use to type in notes).  But these laws do not change the general principle  — that we can type instead of write on paper.
