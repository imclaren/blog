*Forget saving the environment.  Printing at work is a ridiculous waste of time.*

#### 1. Printing at work is ludicrous  

I was forced to print at work a few months ago.  Our internal electronic expenses system requires us to print and sign forms.  I love irony.  But I haven't printed at work since.  I don't print because this significantly increases my personal productivity.  

Don't get me wrong.  I love paper and books.  Lemony Snicket[1] said it best:

> Never trust anyone who has not brought a book with them.

#### 2.  And handwritten work notes are ridiculous

But as I sat in a meeting last week that involved a lot of very serious people scribbling furiously on legal pads.  I thought — what an incredible waste of time. 

Because here's the thing.  It's not real if it's not stored in electronic form.  If its important, we type it.  We store it on a backed-up computer system.  

So I propose that we not write things down.  Instead, let's just type our meeting notes into word documents (or whatever application suits our workflow).  And there is no law against typing meeting notes in an email that you send to yourself.[2]  Whatever works.

Because if we need to write a formal note or memo.  Or otherwise actually use this information.  We don't have to hunt down a particular piece of paper (that may no longer exist).  We don't have to re-type what we have already written.

#### 3.  Wireless technology required

Why is this possible now?  Always-on wireless technology.  The ability to pick up our laptops and take them to any meeting anywhere.  Your organisation lets you do that.  Doesn't it?  

And yes, I find that I also need a smart phone for tasks, and a tablet as a replacement whiteboard.  But that's it.

#### 4.  But I need to print large documents!  Fallacy.

I am a lawyer.  And have printed documents on an enormous scale for over a decade.  For example, when I moved law firms, I archived walls and walls full of floor to ceiling bookcases of printed files.  

Don't get me wrong.  I am not proud of the whole killing rainforests thing.  But my point is that chosing not to print is a productivity issue.  Not an environmental issue.  

Put simply, I am more effective if I don't print, and there is no need to print to be effective.  Even when dealing with huge numbers of huge documents.

#### 5.  And I need to hand write notes, and print to double check my work! Also a fallacy.

Lawyers trained at large firms always double (at least) check their work.  Because if we hand write our changes, and subsequently review an electronic copy, we are much more likely to spot our own typos, errors, and outright mistakes and gaps in logic.  

I was trained to:
- print out a Microsoft Word document; 
- hand write proposed changes;
- ask my secretary to type those changes into the Microsoft Word document ([while always tracking changes](http://iainmclaren.com/2014/07/16/8-steps)); and
- email the document to the client (or the other parties involved in the transaction); and
- print out the document and email to go on the file.

But we get the same result if we make our changes to the electronic document, and then leave the document (preferably overnight) while we move on to something else.  We can then double check (i.e. re-review) the document before we sent it out.    

#### 6.  Don't print.  You will never go back.

I stopped printing documents and, after a month or two, stopped missing the paper copies.  Even for massive documents with multiple attachments. 

I do have a soft spot for the antiquated.  Really.  For example, [Moleskin](http://www.moleskine.com) notebooks are [quite beautiful](http://iainmclaren.com/2014/07/30/perfection/).  But it's time to recognise that printing at work, and writing work notes on paper, is a ridiculous waste of time.  

I suggest that you try not printing at work for three months.  And if you are bold, try going without pen and paper at work as well.  

Oh, and yes, it would also be great if we cut down fewer trees.

[1] And yes Josh, I did just quote Lemony Snicket (from   *Horseradish*).  That's $5 you owe me.   

[2] Well actually, there are some laws that apply in relation to regulated industries (for example) that restrict the transmission of highly sensitive information over the internet (including via email).  But these laws only require us to change our workflow (i.e. potentially change which apps we use to type in notes).  These laws do not change the general principle  — that we can type instead of write on paper.
