### 1. Superstars are smart and get things done

In 2000, [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)
wrote [The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html).  By far the most sensible document that I have ever read about employing people.  Some parts of the document are a bit specific to the technology industry.  But it's worth reading the whole thing.  As Joel says:
> In principle, it’s simple. You’re looking for people who are:
> 
> - Smart; and
> - Get things done.

Zero out of two means that your new hire is hopeless.  And one out of two means that your new hire may actually be worse than not employing anyone at all.  For example, people who get things done but are not smart are an absolute liability.  

Testing for smartness is relatively easy.  Testing whether (or not) your candidate gets hard things done  basically involves checking if that person is already a genuine specialist. 

### 2. The smartness test is easy 

We sometimes think it's hard.  Or overcomplicate our decision making process.  But as Joel says ([seriously, read the whole article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html)), if we are in any doubt about a candidate then we should not employ them: 

> You’re going to see three types of people in your interviews:
> 
> - At one end of the scale, there are the unwashed masses, lacking even the most basic skills for this job. They are easy to ferret out and eliminate, often just by asking two or three quick questions. 
> - At the other extreme you’ve got your brilliant superstars ... 
> - And in the middle, you have a large number of “maybes” who seem like they might just be able to contribute something. 

If in doubt, don't hire:

> The trick is telling the difference between the superstars and the maybes, because the secret is that you don’t want to hire any of the maybes. Ever..

I have made this mistake and it's a big one.  When we need to hire.  And one candidate is fine on paper and better than the other candidates.  But that person does not have a passion for the business.  Or the collective team is unimpressed.  Or hiring them just doesn't feel right.  Then don't hire them.

Don't hire them if it doesn't feel right.  

### 3. And only specialists get hard things done

Now that we have determined that our prospective new hire is smart, can they get things done?  Generally, we test for the ability to get things done by asking for examples of hard achievements or accomplishments.

Because only specialists get hard things done.  Because superstars must have developed those specialist skills while doing those hard things.

These achievements might include getting into (and completing) a sought after University course.  Or military service.  Or setting up and running a successful business or charity.  Or being an accomplished concert violinist.  And it might be multiple achievements or accomplishments. Basically anything genuinely competitive or hard. 

Because in order to have already achieved (in the past), we must have already learned specialist skills.  We must already be a specialist CEO, or engineer, or management consultant, or an accomplished musician.  

### 4. Superstars may be specialists in other fields

Or possibly a few fields.  But please spare me the people who are apparently generally great.  But who are not specialists in any field.

Obviously we would prefer that our new hire has a demonstrated passion for their new job (or at least industry).  But this is not an absolute requirement,  particularly for relatively junior employees.  Superstars are passionate about their area of expertise.  

Still in doubt about testing for people who are smart and get things done?  Help me out Joel:

> Never say “Maybe, I can’t tell.” If you can’t tell, that means No Hire. It’s really easier than you’d think. Can’t tell? Just say no! If you are on the fence, that means No Hire. Never say, “Well, Hire, I guess, but I’m a little bit concerned about…” That’s a No Hire as well. Mechanically translate all the waffling to “no” and you’ll be all right.

> Why am I so hard-nosed about this? It’s because it is much, much better to reject a good candidate than to accept a bad candidate. A bad candidate will cost a lot of money and effort and waste other people’s time ...

### 4. Specialists do hard things and great things

Because by the time that you interview (or meet) these people, these superstars (whether junior or not) will have already accomplished something demonstrably hard.    And hopefully something demonstrably great.  

They will already be experts.  They will already be specialists.  They will already have been accepted into (and completed) a competitive university course.  Or they will have already built their own rocket ship.  Or whatever.

And ... um ... sorry ... what do you mean:

> Why would I want to hire a superstar?

And:

> Won't they be a pain in the neck? 

Sorry, I can't help you there.  Well, maybe I should write another article about how to identify superstar employers ...
