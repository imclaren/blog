title: The rise and fall of the Chief Information Officer (CIO)

*Customer business teams can now outsource their technology to cloud providers, and are doing so while avoiding or ignoring their own technology teams.  What's a CIO to do?*

### 1. CIOs can no longer be pure technologists 

Last year, CIO Magazine published an article titled ["How to Be the CIO of Tomorrow"](http://www.cio.com/article/2849270/cio-role/how-to-be-the-cio-of-tomorrow.html):

> What does the future CIO look like? He or she probably wonâ€™t have a technology background. However, this new kind of CIO will not only have to lead a technical staff but will also be a leader of leaders in the boardroom.

The core argument is that CIOs can no longer be mere technologists.  Technology is now so integral to all businesses, that there is no longer any real distinction between customer business team responsibilities and customer technology team responsibilities.

> Viewing the business through the eyes of the customer is not something that we tend to do as CIOs. We tend to spend a lot of time talking to supporting functions and internal operations. But are we prepared to take an outside-in view of the business? The typical CIO plays within a certain set of boundaries, or a box. Are we willing to step outside of that and drive cross-functional initiatives? If we stick within an IT boundary, we're going to miss the digital transformation agenda.

### 2. But CIOs have lost control of their technology (and information systems) 

The article argues that the role of the CIO has not been diminished, but the following quote is telling:

> I see the CIO as taking the guardian or custodian role, so we don't have shadow IT organizations popping up everywhere. The days of IT strategy getting decided just by the CIO, and the CIO having to convince the CFO or CEO, are gone. The CIO has to be able to take input from all sources and manage and direct the conversation at board level to ensure that we're getting a 360-degree view of what we should be doing.
 
In other words, many, possibly most, CIOs have lost control over how technology (and information systems) are used in their organisations.  Busnesses are moving technology and business funtions to the cloud while avoiding, or outright ignoring, their own technology teams.

### 3. Increasingly, our technology systems are black boxes that we don't understand?

Security professionals have a ... let's call it eccentric ... sense of humour.  We can see this from the rise of [@SwiftOnSecurity](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity), a security professional who insists that she is in fact Taylor Swift, who tweets about information security.  Yes, yes, I know, but bear with me.  InfoSec Taylor Swift recently posted the following:

And here is the core argument.  Our technology systems ahave become brittle and insecure because if no-one in our organisation has a deep understanding of technology, then we will inevitably just believe the supplier sales spin.

> Technical acumen, which has always been seen as a core field for CIOs, I believe will be increasingly acquired from different sources, such as partners, vendors, customers. Some aspect of IT strategy will be crowd-sourced from the business

### 4. A CIO who doesn't understand technology is as dangerous as a CFO who doesn't understand finance

In other words, if a supplier came to you and offered to run all of your finance functions, would you fire your Chief Financial Officer?  Would you accept the risk that you no longer have anyone in your organisation that understands your business finances?

I think not.  And given that technology is now a critical part of all businesses, having a CIO who does not understand technology is as risky as having a CFO who doesn't understand finance.

CIOs now need to know more.  A great CIO has a strong technology background - how can you advise on technology if you don't understand it?  Therefore, a great CIO has both a deep understanding of technology, and a deep understanding of the business in which they work.  A great CIO builds internal and external systems and relationships, works with internal and external stakeholders to improve business processes, and quite simply eats the cloud for breakfast.

Mmmmn tasty.
