Why are manufacturers and retailers more efficient than service companies?


*The former win or die based on the efficiency of their supply chains* 

### 1. All industries can be divided into two categories

Have you noticed that the car industry, large shopping centres, and transport companies have incredibly sophisticated procurement processes, but global services organisations often do not?  It is because industries can be split into two groups:

- organisations that either win or die based on the efficiency of their **supply chains**; and
- organisations that do not, and therefore focus (hopefully relentlessly) on the cost and quality of their **people and technology**.

### 2. Industries with a supply chain focus are incredibly sophisticated  

The car industry is famous for the sophistication of its supply chain and procurement methodologies, but all organisations (and industries) that live or die based on the efficiency of their supply chains have no choice but to have a world class procurement function.

This is why companies that focus on supply chains implement Business Process Reengineering, Just in Time manufacturing, etc. etc.  And this is why the industries with a supply chain focus concentrate on reducing their supply chain costs and increasing their supply chain efficiencies.



These companies have been incredibly effective because while implementing world class supply chain procurement is hard, the target is easier.

The process often begins when a CEO (or CFO or COO) tells her 2IC to just reduce the cost of the supply chain by 10%.  Then the fun begins.
 
### 3. Industries with a people and technology focus are often not so sophisticated

Executives that move from supply chain focused organisations to people and technology focused organisations are often surprised at the lack of procurement sophistication.

This 

 do not live or die based on supply chain efficiencies tend to have less sophisticated procurement functions.
